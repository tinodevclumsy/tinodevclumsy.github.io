## Problem
```
The file does not exist at "/node_modules/.vite/deps/chunk-TCH4NS4S.js?v=debf50b4"
```
This is a compatibility issue that occurs during Vite's dependency optimization process with certain libraries.

## Cause
Vite pre-bundles dependency packages to improve performance when launching the development server. Compatibility issues with some libraries can occur during this process.

## Solutions

### 1. Force Vite Rebuild
```
npx vite --force
```
- This is the simplest solution but may only be temporary.

### 2. Initialize Dependencies and Cache (Recommended)
```
rm -rf node_modules .vite
yarn
```
- Completely removes the node_modules directory and Vite cache
- Clean installation of dependency packages
- This method resolves the issue in most cases.

### 3. Exclude Problematic Packages from Optimization
```
// vite.config.js
export default defineConfig({
  optimizeDeps: {
    exclude: ['problematic_library_name']
  }
})
```
- You need to identify the actual library causing the problem from the error message.
- It may be difficult to identify the exact library from just the chunk filename, so you'll need to test while checking your project's dependency list.
- This method excludes the library from pre-bundling, which might affect performance.
